# frontend-challenges
Development of challenges for company vacancies, extracted from the https://github.com/felipefialho/frontend-challenges repository and tests for other companies not listed in the repo. 

Feel free to improve the code, make it more readable, improve the logic, let's develop!

There is a README for each test that explains what needs to be done!
